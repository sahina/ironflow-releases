#                              mount serve(), never a durable handler body.
#                              Skipped only when the file calls no createFunction().
#   **/components/**/*.tsx   — React components (incl. shadcn ui/** boilerplate)
#   **/components/**/*-provider.tsx — React lifecycle wrappers
#   **/scripts/verify-*.ts   — assertion scripts run from the shell, directly in
#                              scripts/ only. Deliberately NOT all of scripts/
#                              and not nested subtrees: that directory is a
#                              naming convention, not a framework location, and
#                              a scripts/backfill.ts (or scripts/verify-x/y.ts)
#                              holding a real handler must stay covered.
#
# This is a heuristic grep scanner. False positives possible. Always review findings.
#
# Per-line exception:
#   // audit-ignore: <rule> — <why this line is correct as written>
# on the flagged line, or in the `//` or JSDoc (`/** ... */`) comment block
# directly above it. A single-line `/* ... */` is NOT recognised. Naming the
# rule is mandatory, so the pragma cannot silence a different finding that later
# lands on the same line. See suppress().
#
# Known limitations:
#   - missing-expectedversion uses paren counting; parens inside string
#     literals (e.g. `streams.append(id, { msg: ")" }, { expectedVersion })`)
#     will trip the counter and produce a false positive. Full JS tokenizing
#     is out of scope for a bash heuristic. False positives are recoverable,
#     false negatives (missed concurrency bugs) are not — scanner errs on the
#     side of flagging.
