# Package an App with Ironflow

Package the user's app and the Ironflow engine into ONE container, and prove it on the
user's machine. This file is for the user's own app. To operate the engine (Compose
stack, VPS, Kubernetes), read `platform.md`.

**This version packages. It does not deploy.** Never run a deploy command, a registry
push, or a command that costs money. Print those commands in the report.

## Rules

- Never print the API key in the chat. Never write it into a Dockerfile, an image, or a
  committed file.
- Never use the `latest` engine tag. Pin a version.
- Never publish the engine port. Only the app port is published.
- A workflow file is written, never run. Tag the image with the commit SHA, never `latest`.
  Pin each GitHub Action to a full commit SHA, with its release tag in a comment.
- Do not choose packages or a framework for the user. Package the project that exists.
- Step 4 (Plan) is mandatory. Write nothing and run nothing until the user approves the plan
  in the chat.
- Step 6 (Verify) is mandatory. Without a passed verify, report a failure.

## Step 1: Inspect

Find these facts before you ask a question:

| Fact | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Language and dependency file | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod` |
| Web start command | `Procfile`, `package.json` scripts, README, the framework default |
| Worker entry point | the file that calls `Worker(...).run()`, `createWorker(...)`, or `ironflow.NewWorker(...)`; none for a client-only app |
| App port | the start command, `PORT`, the framework default |
| Existing `Dockerfile` or Compose file | project root |
| Ironflow version in use | the SDK pin in the dependency file, else `ironflow version` |
| Git remote and existing workflows | `git remote -v`, `.github/workflows/` |

## Step 2: Interview

Ask only for what Step 1 did not answer. One question at a time, three at most:

1. The web start command.
2. The worker entry point, or "none".
3. The app port.

## Step 3: Check fit

Stop and point to `platform.md` if one of these is true. The single-container shape is
wrong for that project.

- The app must run more than one instance.
- The project uses PostgreSQL for Ironflow (`IRONFLOW_DATABASE_URL`) or an external NATS.
- The functions are push mode and must stay push mode.

If the prompt asks for a CI/CD workflow and the project has no GitHub remote, write the
container only. Say why in the plan.

## Step 4: Plan

Show the plan, then stop. Do not create or change a file, and do not run a command, before
the user approves.

Print the plan in this order:

1. **Detected:** the stack, web command, worker entry point, app port, and the engine
   version you will pin.
2. **Files:** each file you will create or change. For an existing `Dockerfile`, show the
   diff. With a workflow, list `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
3. **Verify:** the exact `docker build` and `docker run` commands, with the container name,
   volume name, and host port.
4. **CI/CD:** only when the prompt asks for it. The branch, the image name
   (`ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>`, lower case), and the line: "The workflow is written here but
   not run here. It runs on your next push to `<branch>`."
5. **Limits:** the known limits (Step 7).
6. **Not doing:** no registry push, no deploy, and the API key is never printed.

End with this question, as the last line of the message: `Do you approve this plan?`

Read the user's next message:

- A clear yes ("yes", "y", "ok", "go ahead", "approved", "looks good") is approval. Go to
  Step 5.
- A change request ("use port 9000", "pin 0.39.0") is not approval. Update the plan, print
  it again, and ask the question again.
- A question, a "no", or an answer you cannot read as yes is not approval. Answer or clarify,
  then ask again. Never take silence, or a yes with a change attached ("yes, but use another
  port"), as approval: apply the change, print the plan, and ask again.

Approval covers the plan as printed. If Step 5 or Step 6 needs a change to it, such as a new
file or a different port, print the change and ask again.

## Step 5: Write

### How it works
<!-- derived-from: examples/flask-single-container/README.md#how-it-works -->

The engine is one static binary. Copy it from the pinned engine image into the app's own
image, then let an entrypoint script start the engine first, hand the key to the app, and
stop the container when a process dies.

The recipe has four slots. Fill them from the project.

| Slot | Python | Node / TypeScript | Go and other |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base image | `python:<version>-slim` | `node:<version>-slim` | build stage + `debian:stable-slim` with `curl` and `jq` |
| Install | `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt` | `npm ci --omit=dev` (or the project's package manager) | copy the built binary |
| Web command | for example `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-8000} app:app` | for example `node dist/server.js` | the binary |
| Worker command | `python worker.py`, or none | `node dist/worker.js`, or none | the worker binary, or none |
| Ready probe | `python -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('$IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL/ready', timeout=2)"` | `node -e "fetch('$IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL/ready').then(r=>process.exit(r.ok?0:1),()=>process.exit(1))"` | `curl -sf "$IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL/ready"` |
| Key read | `python -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))['key'])" "$KEY_FILE"` | `node -p "require(process.argv[1]).key" "$KEY_FILE"` | `jq -r .key "$KEY_FILE"` |

Python is proven in CI by the reference example. The other stacks use the same recipe
and are proven only by Step 6 on this project. Tell the user which case applies.

`Dockerfile` (Python shown; change the slots for other stacks):

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/sahina/ironflow-releases:<engine-version> AS engine

FROM python:<version>-slim
COPY --from=engine /app/ironflow /usr/local/bin/ironflow

RUN useradd --system --create-home app && mkdir /data && chown app:app /data
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

USER app
VOLUME ["/data"]
EXPOSE <app-port>
ENTRYPOINT ["./entrypoint.sh"]
```

`entrypoint.sh` (make it executable). Replace the three marked lines with the slots:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

DATA_DIR=/data
KEY_FILE="$DATA_DIR/.ironflow_bootstrap_key.json"
export IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9123

if [ ! -w "$DATA_DIR" ]; then
  echo "entrypoint: $DATA_DIR is not writable. Mount a volume there." >&2
  exit 1
fi

NATS_STORE_DIR="$DATA_DIR/nats" ironflow serve \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9123 --db "$DATA_DIR/ironflow.db" &
engine=$!

# Install the trap before the readiness wait, so a SIGTERM during startup stops the engine.
pids=()
shutdown() {
  if [ "${#pids[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
    kill -TERM "${pids[@]}" 2>/dev/null || true
    wait "${pids[@]}" 2>/dev/null || true
  fi
  kill -TERM "$engine" 2>/dev/null || true
  wait "$engine" 2>/dev/null || true
}
trap 'shutdown; exit 143' TERM INT

ready=0
for _ in $(seq 1 60); do
  if <READY PROBE> 2>/dev/null; then ready=1; break; fi
  if ! kill -0 "$engine" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "entrypoint: the engine exited before it was ready" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  sleep 1
done
if [ "$ready" != 1 ]; then
  echo "entrypoint: the engine was not ready after 60s" >&2
  exit 1
fi

IRONFLOW_API_KEY="$(<KEY READ>)"
export IRONFLOW_API_KEY

<WORKER COMMAND> & pids+=($!)     # delete this line for a client-only app
<WEB COMMAND> & pids+=($!)

status=0
wait -n || status=$?
shutdown
[ "$status" -eq 0 ] && status=1
exit "$status"
```

Before you write:

- If a `Dockerfile` exists, show the user the diff and ask before you change it.
- Pin `<engine-version>` to the version of the Ironflow SDK that the project uses. Keep
  the SDK and the engine on the same release.
- Create or validate the effective ignore file for every build context: `.dockerignore`,
  or `<Dockerfile>.dockerignore` when present. Exclude `.git`, `node_modules`,
  `__pycache__`, `.ironflow`, and credential files found during inspection. Exclude all
  root and nested environment files with `.env*` and `**/.env*`; put these exclusions
  after any `!` rules that could re-include them. Verify the effective rules exclude
  `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.env.production` before building, even if the file existed.
- The app must read `IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL` and `IRONFLOW_API_KEY` from the environment.
  The worker SDKs do this by default. Check the client code in the web process.

### CI/CD workflow

Only when the prompt asks for it, and only for a GitHub project. Write
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Replace `<branch>` with the branch from the prompt. Keep the
single quotes: without them YAML reads a branch named `true`, `null`, `1.0` or `yes` as a
boolean, null or number, and the workflow never triggers.

```yaml
name: Build and push image

on:
  push:
    branches: ['<branch>']

permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write

jobs:
  image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
      - name: Name the image
        # GHCR rejects upper-case names, and the owner or repository can contain them.
        run: echo "IMAGE=ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY,,}" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
      - uses: docker/login-action@dbcb813823bdd20940b903addbd779551569679f # v4.6.0
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - uses: docker/build-push-action@c3c9e263c25d99ce0380d002d59b67737d91b0dc # v7.4.0
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ env.IMAGE }}:${{ github.sha }}
```

This is the minimum: it builds and pushes. It does not start the image anywhere. Do not add
a deploy step, a `latest` tag, or a secret. If a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists, show
the diff and ask before you change it.

The three SHAs are the releases named in their comments. Before you write the file, check
each action's latest release with `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest --jq .tag_name`.
If a newer release exists, resolve its tag to a commit
(`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/ref/tags/<tag>`, and follow an annotated tag to its commit)
and use that SHA with the new tag in the comment. If you cannot check, keep these three and
say so in the plan.

The complete reference example is `examples/flask-single-container` in
<https://github.com/sahina/ironflow-releases>.

## Step 6: Verify

Run every check. Use a container name and a volume name that are specific to this project.

1. `docker build -t <name>:local .`
2. `docker run -d --name <name> -p 127.0.0.1:<host-port>:<app-port> -v <name>-data:/data <name>:local`
3. Call one app route that uses Ironflow, and confirm that the run completes. A worker
   needs a few seconds to register after start, so retry for up to 30 seconds.
4. `docker restart <name>`, then confirm that the earlier run is still there.
5. After the restart, `docker logs <name> 2>&1 | grep -cE 'ifkey_[A-Za-z0-9]{16,}'` must
   print `0`. The engine banner prints a short key prefix (`ifkey_78e548b5...`). That is
   not a leak, so do not match on `ifkey_` alone.
6. `docker port <name>` must show the app port only.
7. If you wrote a workflow: `actionlint .github/workflows/deploy.yml` must print nothing. If
   `actionlint` is not installed, parse the file with a YAML parser and say that you did not
   lint it. Do not run the workflow.

If a check fails, read `docker logs <name>`, fix the cause, and run all checks again.
Remove the container when you are done. Ask the user before you remove the volume.

## Step 7: Report

Tell the user:

- The files you wrote or changed.
- Which checks passed, with the command for each.
- If the stack is CI-proven (Python) or proven only by Step 6.
- If you wrote a workflow: it was checked, not run. It runs on your next push to
  `<branch>`. It pushes `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:<commit-sha>` and nothing deploys that image.
- The known limits below.
- The commands for a deploy to a host with a persistent volume. Do not run them.

### Known limits
<!-- derived-from: examples/flask-single-container/README.md#known-limits -->

- One instance only. Two containers are two engines with two separate data sets.
- A volume on `/data` is mandatory. Without one, removing the container deletes all runs
  and events.
- The dashboard is not reachable from outside the container.
- The bootstrap key stays on the volume. The published API-keys guide says to read it
  once, delete the file and rotate; this recipe does not.
- A restart stops the engine. There is no zero-downtime deploy.

### CI/CD limits

- The workflow builds and pushes an image. Nothing starts it. A host, and the secrets for it,
  are your next step.
- The first push to a new package makes it private. Make it public or give the host a pull
  token.
- The workflow has no dev or prod split. One branch, one image tag per commit.
- When you change the SDK version, change the engine pin in the `Dockerfile` to the same
  release. Read `migrate.md` before you move an existing `/data` volume to a new engine.
