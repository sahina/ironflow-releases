# Ironflow Ops

Workflow for operating Ironflow at runtime: debugging, migration, and platform ops.
Three sub-domains live in topic files (load on demand).

> **Path convention.** Scripts are named relative to this skill's own directory — your
> harness names that directory when it loads the skill, and a packaged skill serves them as
> readable resources rather than executable files. Reference files in ANOTHER skill are
> shown as `~/.agents/skills/<skill>/...` (global install); if that path does not resolve,
> activate that skill by name instead of guessing at a prefix.

## Reference Files

```
~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/cli.md            # CLI command reference
~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/mcp.md            # MCP tool reference (if available)
~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/anti-patterns.md  # for diagnosing root causes
```

## Sub-Topic Files

```
debug.md           # diagnose failed/stuck/wrong runs
migrate.md         # upgrade SDK + write upcasters
platform.md        # deploy/scale/operate clusters
```

## Sub-Topic Routing

Match the user's request to one of three sub-topics, then read the corresponding file:

| Intent | Read |
|---|---|
| "run failed", "stuck", "wrong output", "missing event", "projection drift", "worker not processing", "KV broken", "entity stream weird" | `debug.md` |
| "upgrade ironflow", "update SDK", "what changed", "migrate to v...", "upcaster", "event schema versioning" | `migrate.md` |
| "deploy", "provision", "scale", "cluster", "tenant", "monitor", "backup", "restore", "docker compose", "self-host", "k3d", "hetzner", "helm", "kubectl" | `platform.md` |

Don't load all three. Load what's relevant.

## Auth (read before running anything)

Every `/api/` path requires authentication — always, no config toggle. Only `/health`,
`/ready`, `/metrics`, `/api/v1/capabilities`, and the auth-login paths are public.

- **Prefer the `ironflow` CLI.** It attaches `IRONFLOW_API_KEY` for you.
- A bare `curl .../api/v1/...` returns `{"error":"authentication required"}` unless the
  server runs `ironflow serve --dev`. If a curl returns nothing useful, suspect auth
  before suspecting the data.
- REST responses are **snake_case** and mostly **enveloped** (`{"steps": […]}`,
  `{"events": […]}`), not bare arrays. camelCase keys like `functionId` don't exist.

## Quick Health Check (Run First for Any Issue)

Call `ironflow_server_info` (health and version), then `ironflow_overview` (function count,
active runs, workers, recent events). Where MCP is unavailable:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9123/health
curl -s http://localhost:9123/ready
```

If the server is unreachable or unhealthy, fix server connectivity before app-level
debugging. This is in `platform.md` (troubleshooting section).

## Cleanup Protocol

If you write any temporary files during ops work (debug scripts, JSON dumps, test event
payloads), delete them at the end. The user's workspace must be left clean. Verify:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/ironflow-debug-* /tmp/if-debug-*
```

Do not leave behind: temp shell scripts, JSON dumps from API queries, test payload files.

---

**Next** (after ops work, depending on outcome):
- `/ironflow-code` — write the fix code, regenerate tests
- `/ironflow-start` — re-architect if the issue revealed a fundamental design problem
- `/ironflow-docs` — look up CLI/SDK syntax for follow-up commands
