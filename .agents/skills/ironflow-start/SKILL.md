# Ironflow Start

Workflow for adopting Ironflow: project setup and architectural decisions.
Codebase fit analysis lives in `ironflow-fit`. SDK syntax lives in `ironflow-docs` (read on demand).

> **Path convention.** Scripts are named relative to this skill's own directory — your
> harness names that directory when it loads the skill, and a packaged skill serves them as
> readable resources rather than executable files. Reference files in ANOTHER skill are
> shown as `~/.agents/skills/<skill>/...` (global install); if that path does not resolve,
> activate that skill by name instead of guessing at a prefix.

## Reference Files

```
~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/sdk-typescript.md   # for code shown during setup
~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/sdk-go.md           # Go equivalent
~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/patterns.md         # for arch decision matrices
~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/cli.md              # for ironflow init / serve commands
```

## Mode Selection

| Intent | Mode |
|---|---|
| "set up", "install", "configure ironflow", "walk me through" | **Setup** |
| "push vs pull", "entity streams vs events", architecture question | **Architecture Decision** |

Asked whether Ironflow *fits* — "should I use ironflow", "where can we use it",
"fit my app", "analyze my codebase" — that is `ironflow-fit`, not this skill.
Read `~/.agents/skills/ironflow-fit/SKILL.md` and follow it.

If ambiguous, ask once.

---

## Mode 1: Setup

Interactive guided setup. Always present options to the user — never assume.

### Step 1: Detect project

```bash
scripts/detect-project.sh
```

Relative to this skill's own directory, which your harness names when it loads the skill.
If the script cannot be executed — a packaged skill is served as readable resources, not
as files on disk — read `scripts/detect-project.sh` as a skill resource and apply its patterns with the
search tools instead. The fields below are what the rest of this skill branches on, so produce all of them
even when a value is `unknown` or `none`.

Output: `framework=<nextjs|hono|express|remix|node|go|unknown> language=<ts|go|both|none>
ironflow_installed=<true|false> ironflow_cli=<version|none> package_manager=<...>`.

`ironflow_installed` is about the SDK in this project; `ironflow_cli` is about the engine
binary on PATH. They move independently — a project can have the SDK with no engine, or
an engine with no project.

If `ironflow_installed=true`, present what was found and ask:

> "Ironflow is already set up. Want to:
> 1. Switch execution mode (push ↔ pull)
> 2. Add browser SDK
> 3. Add a function (use `/ironflow-code` instead)
> 4. Update SDK
> 5. Start fresh"

On "Update SDK": the skills are compiled into the `ironflow` binary, so after upgrading
it run `ironflow skills sync` (add `--local` to vendor into `./.agents/skills`) and
`ironflow skills doctor` to re-wire the agent. Otherwise on-disk skills describe an
older engine than the one running.

If `language=both`, ask which to use. If `framework=unknown`, ask user to confirm or
suggest scaffolding via `ironflow init`.

### Step 2: Get an engine running
<!-- derived-from: docs/tutorials/getting-started.mdx#1-start-the-server -->
<!-- derived-from: docs/tutorials/installation.mdx#desktop-app -->

The SDK is a client. It needs an `ironflow` engine to talk to, and on a clean machine
there isn't one. Don't skip to `pnpm add` — the user will hit `command not found:
ironflow` at the verify step.

If Step 1 reported a version for `ironflow_cli`, the binary is already there — say so and
skip to starting it. If it reported `none`, ask:

> "First, Ironflow itself. Four ways:
> 1. **Desktop app** — bundles the engine. No install, no CLI, no Docker. Fastest way to
>    see it work: <https://github.com/sahina/ironflow-desktop-releases/releases/latest>
>    (macOS Apple Silicon is the supported platform; Windows/Linux are experimental.)
> 2. **Homebrew** — `brew install sahina/tap/ironflow`
> 3. **Scoop** (Windows, experimental) — `scoop bucket add ironflow https://github.com/sahina/scoop-ironflow`, then `scoop install ironflow/ironflow`
> 4. **Docker** — `docker run -p 9123:9123 ghcr.io/sahina/ironflow-releases:latest serve --dev`"

Then start it:

```bash
ironflow serve --dev      # localhost:9123 — SQLite, embedded NATS, auth disabled
```

**`--dev` is not optional for local work.** Auth is always enforced otherwise — there is
no config toggle — so every `ironflow emit`, SDK call, and dashboard request returns
`401 authentication required`. Dropping `--dev` (production) auto-bootstraps an admin
key written to `<db-dir>/.ironflow_bootstrap_key.json` (mode 0400), which you then pass
as `IRONFLOW_API_KEY`.

That `<db-dir>` is `.ironflow/` under the cwd by default, and `serve` fills it with the
SQLite db, the embedded NATS store and `blobs/`. Gitignore the whole directory before the
first commit — the bootstrap key and `.ironflow_jwt_secret` beside it are live
credentials. `ironflow init` templates already ignore it; an existing project won't.

Desktop users: the app runs an engine per workspace, so there's no `ironflow serve` to
run. Point the SDK at the server URL the app shows.

### Step 3: Choose execution mode

Don't default. Show both:

> "Push mode — Ironflow POSTs to your serverless endpoint. Best for Next.js API routes,
>   Vercel, Lambda. Hard 10s ceiling per dispatch.
>
> Pull mode — Your worker polls Ironflow over HTTP for jobs. Best for
>   long-running tasks, Go services, anything past 10s. No timeout.
>
> Which mode? You can add the other later."

Pull is **HTTP polling** (`GET /api/v1/workers/{id}/jobs`), not gRPC. An opt-in
ConnectRPC streaming worker exists at `@ironflow/node/worker-streaming`; it is not
the default and not what `createWorker` does.

The 10s push ceiling is the **engine's**, not your host's: `PushTimeout` defaults to 10s
and the effective budget is `min(function timeout_ms, PushTimeout)`. Raising the
function's `timeout` does not raise it. On a self-hosted server you can raise the
ceiling itself with `engine.pushTimeout` in `ironflow.yaml` (`ironflow serve -f ...`);
on a server you do not control, anything longer must be pull.

Go has both — `ironflow.NewWorker` (pull) and `ironflow.Serve` (push). Pull is the
natural fit for a Go service, but don't tell the user Go is pull-only.

### Step 4: Install SDK
<!-- derived-from: docs/tutorials/installation.mdx#typescript-sdk -->

TypeScript:
```bash
pnpm add @ironflow/node                  # required — pulls in @ironflow/core
pnpm add @ironflow/browser               # optional, for client-side real-time
pnpm add @ironflow/langgraph             # optional, durable checkpoints for LangGraph
```

Go:
```bash
go get github.com/sahina/ironflow-go/ironflow
```

`@ironflow/core` is a transitive dependency of node and browser — don't install it
separately. The Go import path is the public mirror; `github.com/sahina/ironflow/sdk/go/...`
is engine-internal and won't resolve for users.

### Step 5: Scaffold or build manually
<!-- derived-from: docs/tutorials/getting-started.mdx#2-create-your-project -->

**Fresh project** — `ironflow init my-app`, or `ironflow init my-app --template
go-quickstart`. Those are the only two templates (`quickstart` is the TS default);
anything else errors. It runs `pnpm install` for you — `--skip-install` opts out.

What it actually produces is **flat**: one `worker.ts` (or `main.go`) holding a function,
a projection, and the worker, plus `package.json` / `tsconfig.json`. No `src/`, no
`.env`, no push-mode route. Don't promise the user a directory tree it doesn't create.

If the user passes `--skip-install`, tell them to delete the template's
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` before installing — they point at monorepo
paths that don't exist in their project, and the install step is what removes them.

**Existing project** — no layout is required; the SDK imports from wherever you put
things. If the user wants a convention, offer this one and say it's a suggestion:

```
src/functions/<name>.ts          # function definitions
src/projections/<name>.ts        # projection definitions
src/events/<domain>-events.ts    # event name constants
worker.ts                        # createWorker entry point (pull)
app/api/ironflow/route.ts        # serve() handler (Next.js push)
```

### Step 6: Create entry point

For SDK syntax, read `~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/sdk-typescript.md` (or `sdk-go.md`).

**Push mode (Next.js)** — `app/api/ironflow/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { serve, createClient } from "@ironflow/node";
import { hello } from "@/functions/hello";

const allFunctions = [hello];

export const POST = serve({ functions: allFunctions });

// GET = register functions (call once after deploy)
export async function GET() {
  const client = createClient({
    serverUrl: process.env.IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL!,
    apiKey: process.env.IRONFLOW_API_KEY,
  });
  for (const fn of allFunctions) {
    await client.registerFunction({
      id: fn.config.id,
      triggers: fn.config.triggers,
      endpointUrl: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/api/ironflow`,
    });
  }
  return NextResponse.json({ registered: true });
}
```

Two things to flag before the user builds on this:

- **`registerFunction` does not carry `recording`.** Its payload is `id`, `name`,
  `description`, `triggers`, `retry`, `timeoutMs`, `concurrency`, `debounce`,
  `preferredMode`, `endpointUrl`, `actorKey`, `cancelOn` — nothing else. A push function
  registered this way runs with `recording: false`, so `ironflow inspect` has no frames
  to replay, no matter what the `createFunction` config says. `secrets`, `metadata`, and
  `stepTimeout` are dropped the same way. Pull mode's `worker.start()` sends all of them.
  If time-travel debugging matters, that's an argument for pull.
- `serve()` returns `Promise<Response | void>` (it also accepts Node req/res). Next.js
  typed-route checking can reject that as a route export; cast if `next build` complains.

**Pull mode** — `worker.ts` or `cmd/worker/main.go`:

```typescript
import { createWorker } from "@ironflow/node";
import { hello } from "./functions/hello";

const worker = createWorker({
  serverUrl: process.env.IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL || "http://localhost:9123",
  functions: [hello],
});
await worker.start();   // automatically registers all functions
```

**Sample function** — `src/functions/hello.ts`:

```typescript
import { createFunction } from "@ironflow/node";

const HelloEvents = { REQUESTED: "hello.requested" } as const;

export const hello = createFunction(
  {
    id: "hello",
    triggers: [{ event: HelloEvents.REQUESTED }],
    recording: true,
  },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    return await step.run("greet", async () => ({
      message: `Hello, ${(event.data as any)?.name ?? "World"}!`,
    }));
  },
);
```

### Step 7: Configure environment

Create `.env.example`:

```env
IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:9123
# IRONFLOW_API_KEY=ifkey_...              # REQUIRED unless the server runs with --dev

# Push mode:
# IRONFLOW_SIGNING_KEY=...                # verifies Ironflow's signature on inbound POSTs
# NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000   # your app's own URL — you build endpointUrl from it

# Server-side only (not read by the SDK):
# IRONFLOW_DATABASE_URL=postgres://...    # production
```

`IRONFLOW_URL` is a live alias, but only on some paths. `serve()` (push) and the
`@ironflow/node/agent` module check it **before** `IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL`, so a stale
`IRONFLOW_URL` in the shell silently wins over `.env`. `createWorker` and `createClient`
ignore it entirely and read `IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL` only — so this explains a misrouted
push handler, never a misrouted worker.

Sharper still: webhook emit inside `serve()` falls back to `IRONFLOW_URL` **only**. Set
just `IRONFLOW_SERVER_URL` with no explicit `serverUrl` and webhook events are silently
not emitted.

There is no `APP_URL` convention in Ironflow — for a non-Next framework, name your app's
own URL variable whatever you like; only your registration code reads it.

Add to `.gitignore` if missing: `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.ironflow/` — `serve` writes
the local SQLite db, embedded NATS store and `blobs/` there, alongside
`.ironflow_bootstrap_key.json` (an admin API key) and `.ironflow_jwt_secret`. Setting
`spec.storage.path` moves all of it to that file's directory, so ignore that path instead.

### Step 8: Verify

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1
ironflow serve --dev

# Terminal 2 (push mode)
pnpm dev
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ironflow   # register functions

# Terminal 2 (pull mode)
npx tsx worker.ts
# or: go run ./cmd/worker
```

Then test:
```bash
ironflow emit hello.requested --data '{"name": "Ironflow"}'
ironflow run list --json
```

`run list --json` prints an array of `{id, function, status, started_at, ended_at}`.
Empty array after an emit usually means the function never registered (push: did the
GET run? pull: is the worker connected?), not that it failed.

If these 401, the server is running without `--dev` — either restart it with `--dev` or
export `IRONFLOW_API_KEY` from the bootstrap key file. The CLI reads the key only from
that env var; there is no `--api-key` flag on `emit` or `run`.

### Step 9: Suggest next

> "Setup complete. Next:
> - `/ironflow-code` to write your real functions, projections, workers, tests
> - `/ironflow-start` (architecture mode) to choose patterns
> - `/ironflow-ops` once you have failed runs to debug"

## Mode 2: Fit Analysis — moved

Codebase fit analysis now lives in its own skill. It scans Java/Spring, C#/.NET,
Python, Rust, Node and Go, scores event-driven readiness, and writes a visual HTML
report with `file:line` evidence.

Read and follow `~/.agents/skills/ironflow-fit/SKILL.md`.

---

## Mode 3: Architecture Decision

Walk the user through the relevant decision. Don't dump all matrices at once — pick the
2-3 that apply.

For full decision matrices and examples: `Read ~/.agents/skills/ironflow-docs/patterns.md`.

### CQRS mental model (read this first if the app has a real domain)

Before choosing primitives, decide whether the user is building **CRUD-style** or
**CQRS-style**:

| CRUD-style (simpler) | CQRS-style (domain-rich) |
|---|---|
| One model, one DB, same shape for reads and writes | **Two models** — write model (aggregate + stream) and read model (projections) |
| Controllers call ORM, return rows | HTTP dispatches **commands**; commands return acknowledgement, not state |
| Events (if any) are notifications after the fact | Events **are** the state — stored, folded, projected |
| Business rules in service layer / controller | Invariants in the **aggregate decider** (pure function) |
| Read-your-own-writes is trivial (same transaction) | Reads are **eventually consistent** — handled via `subscribeToProjection` or optimistic UI |

CQRS pays off when: you have rich business rules, multiple read shapes, audit
requirements, or long-running processes. It's overhead when: the app is a form+table
CRUD with one read view.

Ironflow supports both. Don't force CQRS on simple CRUD; don't simulate CRUD on top of
Ironflow either. Ask the user — most real apps have **pockets** of each.

### Decision quick reference

| Decision | Choose A when... | Choose B when... |
|---|---|---|
| **Push** vs **Pull** | Tasks under the 10s engine ceiling, serverless | Anything past 10s, persistent workers |
| **CRUD** vs **CQRS** for a given entity | Simple form-and-table, no multi-view reads | Rich rules, multi-view reads, lifecycle events |
| **Plain Events** vs **Entity Streams** | Fire-and-forget signals, no per-entity ordering | Entity lifecycles, DDD aggregates, invariants |
| **Command Event** vs **Direct Append** | Validation needed, auth context, retriable | Internal state transitions with no rules |
| **Aggregate size: small** vs **large** | Contention, distinct lifecycles, fast fold | All state loaded together, invariants span parts |
| **Managed** vs **External Projection** | Pure read models | Side effects (DB sync, emails) |
| **Single projection** vs **Multiple projections** | One view shape | Multiple query paths (by-customer, by-status, etc.) |
| **Step Compensation** vs **Saga** | Simple undo within one fn | Complex rollback across services |
| **Concurrency Limit** vs **Key** | Global rate limiting | Per-entity serialization |
| **`step.parallel`** vs **`step.map`** | Fixed set of operations | Dynamic list of same op |
| **KV Store** vs **External DB** | Small, key-value, real-time | Relational, complex queries |
| **Config** vs **KV Store** | App settings, feature flags | User-facing data |
| **Config** vs **Secrets** | Non-sensitive | API keys, passwords |
| **Optimistic UI** vs **Wait-for-projection** | Most actions (reconcile via subscribe) | Critical confirmations (checkout, payment) |
| **Snapshots: yes** vs **no** | Aggregate history > ~10k events, load latency budget breached | Day-one; revisit when measured |

### Workflow

1. Ask 1-2 clarifying questions about their constraints (deployment target, task duration,
   data shape, whether the entity has a real lifecycle vs. simple storage).
2. **First gate: CRUD or CQRS?** — for domain-rich entities, check whether the user wants
   event-sourced write model. If yes, continue through aggregate/command decisions. If
   no, skip to infra decisions (push/pull, KV/DB, etc.).
3. Identify the 2-3 decisions that matter for their case.
4. State the recommendation clearly with rationale.
5. Note when the alternative would be better.
6. If CQRS: name the aggregates, commands, domain events, and at least one projection
   before moving on. These become the skeleton `/ironflow-code` builds.
7. Suggest `/ironflow-code` to implement.

---

**Next:** After setup or decisions:
- `/ironflow-code` — write the code
- `/ironflow-ops` — debug failures, deploy, scale
- `/ironflow-docs` — look up specific syntax
